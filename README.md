# SIR-epidemiological-model

The Kermack-Mckendrik SIR Model model has been used to analyze number of infected cases at country level for India.
The algorithm gives the peak of the pandemic. The algorithm also calculates the maximum number of people that will be infected, the number of intensive care patients assuming 2% of the infected will need intensive care. The model also calculates death rate which is number of deaths/confirmed cases then the total deaths calculated by maximum infected Ã— death rate.
